# Raphael.group

This library adds a group method to the Raphael object that allows you to treat a set of elements as a group. For instance, when animating a group to a new x location, all elements will have the same relative distance at the end of the animation as they did at the beginning.

Currently requires that you're using Raphael.js cutting-edge. Supports Rahpael 1.4.7 w/ a minor change to Raphael.
